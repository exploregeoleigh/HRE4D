This notebook is used for visualising the output logfile of E4D, even as it runs. This should help you know precisly where an inversion is at at any given time.

Currently it does Tikhonov plots and Chi2 plots for both DC and IP inversions pretty well. Simply open, and follow the brief instructions in it to run it.


Run with jupyter. If you dont have jupyter, the easiest method to get it is to install anaconda:
https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
Then make sure a conda environment is active - open a terminal and either check for the (base) text at the start of a command line, or run 
 > conda activate
 
 then to launch one run
 > jupyter notebook
 
 navigate to the notebook you wish to open, and open it
